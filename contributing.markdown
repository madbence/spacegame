## pull requests

- non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work
- new featutes *should* have tests
- don't include unrelated changes
- use the [karma git commit message conventions][commit-conventions]
- you might be asked to do changes to your pr. there is never a need to open another pr, just update the existing one. see [`git rebase --interactive`][git-rebase]
